## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent fraud detection system capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. Given the extreme class imbalance (fraud accounts for less than 0.2% of all records), this work explores both traditional and deep learning techniques, complemented by various data balancing strategies.
